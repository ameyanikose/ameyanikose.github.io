      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        This summer, amidst the pandemic, I got a chance to intern at Garage
        Microsoft India. <br />The Garage offers a unique opportunity to work
        with other interns across the country in teams, hack on contemporary
        technology, conduct customer research, design, and develop a product or
        build a prototype in 12-16 weeks. <br />I was offered an internship of
        10 weeks, but it was extended by half a week for the Hackathon. Me and
        other UX Interns were given the opportunity to select the project of our
        choice under Garage. <br />The team that I chose to work with was Team
        for EDU for K-12 Community. The team consisted of four developer interns
        and one UX intern and managers and coaches.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Microsoft Teams is a universal communication and collaboration platform
        that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage,
        and application integration. The project that I selected was
        specifically in the domain of Education for Teams. This version of the
        Teams that is Teams for EDU allows teachers to distribute, provide
        feedback, and grade student assignments turned-in via Teams using the
        Assignments tab, available to Office 365 for Education subscribers.
        Quizzes can also be assigned to students through integration with Office
        Forms. The brief of the project was to improve the mobile experience for
        the K-12 community. As the brief was pretty abstract and, this project
        is my attempt at nar- rowing down the project brief and coming up with
        possible solutions for the same.

      <h1>Timeline and Outcomes</h1>
      <p>
        Starting off during weeks 1 and 2, I performed the secondary research
        where I understood the user groups and their problems, studied the app,
        and understood online education, in general. Then during the 3rd week, I
        compiled, bucketed, and validated all the problems that I had figured
        out during the research phase and after that, I selected one problem
        statement to define the narrow down brief for the project. After that, I
        read more related to the defined brief and then moved on to the ideation
        part where I brainstormed possible solutions for the problems that were
        present, and I created low-fidelity mockups for some of the solutions.
        After that, during the 5th and 6th weeks, I created high fidelity
        mockups for the solutions that I had chosen. After syncing with the
        developers in the team, and checking the feasibility of the solution
        during my 7th week, we tried implementing the feasible solution in the
        form of a POC during the 8th week. In the 9th week, I helped the
        developers to fit and finish the POC. During the 10th and 11th weeks,
        our team prepared for an Inter-Garage Demo and for the Hackathon.

      <h1>Learnings and Next Steps</h1>
      <p>
        There was a lot to learn from the 11-week experience as a UX intern at
        Microsoft. Building connections, working in a team, developing
        leadership and skills, and learning from failures were some key
        takeaways from this experience. Apart from this, thanks to the unique
        situation of the pandemic, that helped me learn to manage home-work
        balance, during work-from-home. Some of the reviews and feedback that
        were provided were learning to manage time and expectations and having a
        structured approach towards solving a problem. Overall the experience
        was highly productive, insightful, and fun. The experience of Garage for
        me, personally, was a great opportunity to convert one’s wild-creative
        ideas into full-fledged products and learn this process simultaneously.
        I highly recommend any student who has a keen interest in such a
        start-up/incubation/hack-culture environment to apply for the internship
        at Garage.
