      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work with Think Gudd, a
        cause communication studio based in Bangalore. I worked as a Design
        Intern for multiple projects in the fields of Communication design,
        Filmmaking and Interaction Design. Think Gudd is associated with many
        NGOs to reach out to more people by building their identity,
        strategising their campaigns and creating an online presence. I worked
        with some of these organisations from 3rd June 2019 to 8th July 2019,
        namely Gandhigram Trust, Khadi and Village Industries, Agastya
        Foundation and NIAS Workshop. It was a month filled with travel, work,
        fun and meeting new people.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>Contribution</h1>
      <p>
        I worked with my batchmate Harshit Satija, to serve the organisations
        listed. We developed a Website and a Video for both Gandhigram and Khadi
        and Village Industries, to create a better online presence and make
        people aware about their noble cause. We worked together on another film
        together with Agastya International Foundation to promote their I-Mobile
        lab. We also, along with our mentor Subramanyam Shastri, conducted a
        workshop at NIAS for improving illustration skills in children.

      <h1>About Gandhigram</h1>
      <p>
        Gandhigram Trust works to enhance the socio-economic status of village
        communities through interventions in sectors like health and education
        following Gandhian principles. The outreach programs are aimed at
        promoting the establishment of village industries and providing
        rehabilitation to those in need. The Trust overviews 16 organisations in
        the field of Education, Healthcare, Community Development and
        Rehabilitation, listed below: 
        <ul class ="list">
          <li>Soundaram Vidyalaya </li>
          <li>Gandhigram Primary School</li>
          <li>Lakshmi college of education</li>
          <li>Thambihottam higher secondary school </li>
          <li>Dr. Soundram Trust</li>
          <li>Kasturba Hospital</li>
          <li>Lakshmi Seva Sangham </li>
          <li>Kasturba Sevikashram Santi School for deaf and dumb</li>
          <li>Avvai Ashram</li>
          <li>Soubhagya Illam</li>
          <li>Khadi and Village Industries</li>
          <li>Public Charitable Trust</li>
          <li>Village Extension Program</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h1>Primary Research</h1>
      <p>
        To study the functioning by the trust, we travelled to Gandhigram and Sivasailam 
        to observe and interview the people who were managing different sectors. We received
         help from Subramanyam, who helped translate and guided me as well. We also talked with
          the people who were working in different sectors of the trust. On interviewing an artisan
           we found that his family had been with the trust for three generations. He also told how 
           he studied in the school of trust itself and continued the profession after his father. After noting
            down the information and interpreting the interviews we were able to categorise the work done by different
            sectors of the trust.

      <h1>Learnings and Next Steps</h1>
      <p>
        There was a lot to learn from the 11-week experience as a UX intern at
        Microsoft. Building connections, working in a team, developing
        leadership and skills, and learning from failures were some key
        takeaways from this experience. Apart from this, thanks to the unique
        situation of the pandemic, that helped me learn to manage home-work
        balance, during work-from-home. Some of the reviews and feedback that
        were provided were learning to manage time and expectations and having a
        structured approach towards solving a problem. Overall the experience
        was highly productive, insightful, and fun. The experience of Garage for
        me, personally, was a great opportunity to convert one’s wild-creative
        ideas into full-fledged products and learn this process simultaneously.
        I highly recommend any student who has a keen interest in such a
        start-up/incubation/hack-culture environment to apply for the internship
        at Garage.
      </p>
