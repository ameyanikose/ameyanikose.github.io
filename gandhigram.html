      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work with Think Gudd, a
        cause communication studio based in Bangalore. I worked as a Design
        Intern for multiple projects in the fields of Communication design,
        Filmmaking and Interaction Design. Think Gudd is associated with many
        NGOs to reach out to more people by building their identity,
        strategizing their campaigns and creating an online presence. I worked
        with some of these organizations from 3rd June 2019 to 8th July 2019,
        namely Gandhigram Trust, Khadi and Village Industries, Agastya
        Foundation and NIAS Workshop. It was a month filled with travel, work,
        fun and meeting new people.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>Contribution</h1>
      <p>
        I worked with my batchmate Harshit Satija, to serve the organizations
        listed. We developed a Website and a Video for both Gandhigram and Khadi
        and Village Industries, to create a better online presence and make
        people aware about their noble cause. We worked together on another film
        together with Agastya International Foundation to promote their I-Mobile
        lab. We also, along with our mentor Subramanyam Shastri, conducted a
        workshop at NIAS for improving illustration skills in children.

      <h1>About Gandhigram</h1>
      <p>
        Gandhigram Trust works to enhance the socio-economic status of village
        communities through interventions in sectors like health and education
        following Gandhian principles. The outreach programs are aimed at
        promoting the establishment of village industries and providing
        rehabilitation to those in need. The Trust overviews 16 organizations in
        the field of Education, Healthcare, Community Development and
        Rehabilitation, listed below:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Soundaram Vidyalaya</li>
        <li>Gandhigram Primary School</li>
        <li>Lakshmi college of education</li>
        <li>Thambihottam higher secondary school</li>
        <li>Dr. Soundram Trust</li>
        <li>Kasturba Hospital</li>
        <li>Lakshmi Seva Sangham</li>
        <li>Kasturba Sevikashram Santi School for deaf and dumb</li>
        <li>Avvai Ashram</li>
        <li>Soubhagya Illam</li>
        <li>Khadi and Village Industries</li>
        <li>Public Charitable Trust</li>
        <li>Village Extension Program</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Primary Research</h1>
      <p>
        To study the functioning by the trust, we travelled to Gandhigram and
        Sivasailam to observe and interview the people who were managing
        different sectors. We received help from Subramanyam, who helped
        translate and guided me as well. We also talked with the people who were
        working in different sectors of the trust. On interviewing an artisan we
        found that his family had been with the trust for three generations. He
        also told how he studied in the school of trust itself and continued the
        profession after his father. After noting down the information and
        interpreting the interviews we were able to categorize the work done by
        different sectors of the trust.The trust was very proud of their legacy
        so we also looked at their archives and studied their history. This made
        me sensitive to the problems that they solved in the past and how they
        are fighting current problems.
      </p>

      <h1>Secondary Research</h1>
      <p>
        We studied Gandhian philosophies and read his texts like Third Class in
        Indian Railways. Then we analysed how the trust were following his
        principles like self-reliance and sustainability while creating jobs
        among themselves. After that we studied the current website to find the
        information architecture and the problems in that.
      </p>

      <h1>Information architecture</h1>
      <p>
        After having done the research we re-categorized the work done and
        divided it into following 4 categories : Education, Healthcare,
        Rehabilitation and Community Development. This was the starting point.
        Then we began with current website’s information architecture and added
        multiple points which we felt were necessary. After that we grouped up
        the information what we could.

      <h1>Defining User Experience & Website Flow</h1>
      <p>
        First we defined a rough target audience can be and then took it from
        there. Then we made some personas to figure out in what order the user
        would require information and how would he want to navigate between
        information. Then this sort of clubbed the information pieces into
        different pages for us.
        <br />
        After deciding the pages and the content on them, we started making the
        flow and navigation between them.

      <h1>Defining Visual Identity and Grammar</h1>
      <p>
        We created a modern/contemporary version of the website with a subtle
        yet engaging aesthetic. The idea was to give a neutral interpretation of
        the institution’s philosophy, visually. This was achieved by using
        photographs to reduce cognitive load over the website along with a huge
        amount of negative spaces. Keywords - Un-ornamented, Soothing, Calm,
        Comfortable, Legacy, Authentic, Honest, Resolute, Natural

      <h1>Colour Palette</h1>
      <p>
        The colour palette reflects the neutrality in interpretation of the
        website. It also reflects the Soothing, Calm, Comfortable feeling that
        was required for the website.

      <h1>Interactivity</h1>
      <p>
        The interactions were kept very subtle with the theme. Ease in-out fades
        were incorporated inn the website to provide a sense of calmness.

      <h1>Fonts</h1>
      <p>
        We searched a variety of serif open source fonts like Crimson Text, EB
        Garamond, Cormorant Family, Vollkorn, Amiri etc. Most of the fonts had a
        less no. of variations. The Cormorant family, Crimson Text and Vollkorn
        had a fair number of styles. The contrast of the Cormorant family is too
        low to be legible. Vollkorn was finalized along with a sans-serif font -
        Rubik.

        The logo of the Trust was redesigned to complement the
        modern/contemporary look of the website. Multiple iterations of the logo
        resulted in selecting a three dimensional version of the logo. Favicon
        was also extracted from the logo that was used in the main site.

      <h1>Layout and Creating a Responsive Version</h1>
      <p>
        The layout of the website consists of jumps between fully stretched
        images to a narrow column and centre aligned text format. Use of white
        space was intended to focus on the content and also provide a neat and
        spacious experience to the user. A hamburger was placed in place of the
        menu for the mobile and tablet version of the website. The content was
        managed according to the screen size of each of the default devices.

      <h1>Video Brief</h1>
      <p>
        The focus of the video was to create a call for action in the viewer and
        make them contribute to the organization in one way or another.
      </p>
      <h1>Coming up with a narrative</h1>
      <p>
        The focus of the video was to create a call for action in the viewer and
        make them contribute to the organization in one way or another.
        Gandhigram has a very rich legacy and the problems that they have solved
        since their inception, Thus it became the main focus to create the cause
        in the viewer’s eyes.
      </p>
      <h1>Storyboards</h1>
      <p>
        After a lot of discussion, two ideas materialized, one of which was to
        go linear and show the importance of Gandhigram by going into a
        hypothetical scenario where It didn’t exist, thus creating a call for
        action. The second was to create the importance by showing the current
        state and then going back in time to show the changes brought by
        Gandhigram, thus creating its importance. After a lot of simulations and
        watch existing videos of same kind, we went ahead with the first idea.
      </p>
      <h1>Shot selection</h1>
      <p>
        For the first part of history, the shots selected were from the
        archives, showing the development of Gandhigram. Then for the current
        work done by the different sections, we decided to focus on the people
        and capture their emotions, to bring the emotional connect.
      </p>
      <h1>Editing</h1>
      <p>
        The Edit was done with the music and the length of the shots were also
        kept rhythmic so as the video harmonizes with the song. Certain times a
        motion was kept in between the cuts, so as the viewer doesn’t feel
        visual jerks.
      </p>
      <h1>Dynamic typo</h1>
      <p>
        The Dynamic Typography used was kept similar to the subtle theme. The
        appearance of text slowly creates a calm and soothing feel, like how one
        feels in Gandhigram itself.
      </p>
      <h1>Music selection and arrangement</h1>
      <p>
        The music used for the video is a royalty free song complementing the
        importance of legacy and development of the trust. Change of pace of the
        song at certain positions emphasizes each subtopics in the video.
